/// @title TournamentTimeAbstract - abstract contract for controlling time for Cheeze Wizards.
/// @notice Time is important in Cheeze Wizards, and there are a variety of different ways of
/// slicing up time that we should clarify here at the outset:
///
///  1. The tournament is split into three major PHASES:
///      - The first Phase is the Admission Phase. During this time, Wizards can be entered into
///        the tournament with their admission fee, and will be given a power level commensurate
///        with that fee. Their power level can not exceed the base power level encoded into the NFT.
///        No duels take place during this phase.
///      - The second Phase is the Revival Phase. During this time, new Wizards can enter the tournament,
///        eliminated Wizards can be revived, and the dueling commences!
///      - The third phase is the Elimination Phase. It's all duels, all the time. No new Wizards can enter,
///        all eliminations are _final_. It's at this time that the Blue Mold begins to grow, forcing
///        Wizards to engage in battle or be summarily eliminated.
///      - Collectively the phases where Wizards can enter the tournament (i.e. Admission Phase and
///        Revival Phase) are the Enter Phases.
///      - Collectively the phases where Wizards can duel (i.e. Revival Phase and Elimination Phase)
///        are the Battle Phases.
///
///  2. During the Battle Phases, where Wizards can duel, we break time up into a series of repeating WINDOWS:
///      - The first Window is the Ascension Window. During the Elimination Phase, Ascension Windows are critically
///        important: Any Wizard which is in danger of being eliminated by the next Blue Mold power increase
///        can attempt to Ascend during this time. If multiple Wizards attempt to Ascend, they are paired
///        off into Duels to Exhaustion: A one-time, winner-takes-all battle that sees one Wizard triumphant
///        and the other Wizard eliminated from the tournament. If an odd number of Wizards attempt to Ascend,
///        the last Wizard to attempt to Ascend remains in the Ascension Chamber where they _must_ accept the
///        first duel challenge offered to them in the following Fight Window. During the Revival Phase, the time
///        slice which would be an Ascension Windows is counted as more or less nothing.
///      - The second Window is the Fight Window. This is where all the fun happens! Wizards challenge Wizards,
///        and their duels result in power transfers. But beware! If your power level drops to zero (or below
///        the Blue Mold level), you will be eliminated!
///      - The third Window is the Resolution Window. This is a period of time after the Fight Window equal
///        to the maximum length of a duel. During the Resolution Window, the only action that most Wizards
///        can take is to reveal moves for duels initiated during the Fight Window. However, this is also the
///        time slice during which a successfully Ascending Wizard is able to power up!
///      - The fourth Window is the Culling Window. During the Elimination Phase, the Culling Window is used
///        to permanently remove all Wizards who have been reduced to zero power (are tired), or who have fallen below
///        the power level of the inexorable Blue Mold.
///
/// 3. A complete sequence of four Windows is called a SESSION. During the official Cheeze Wizard tournament,
///    we will set the Session length to as close to 8 hours as possible (while still using blocks as time
///    keeping mechanism), ensuring three Sessions per day. Other Tournaments may have very different time limits.
